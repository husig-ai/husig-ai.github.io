      <description>How intelligent data obfuscation unlocked collaboration without compromising privacy&#xA;Companies sit on valuable production data they can&amp;rsquo;t share—with vendors, partners, or even internal teams. PII regulations, contractual obligations, and security policies lock data behind approval processes that take weeks.&#xA;A healthcare company can&amp;rsquo;t share patient data with an ML vendor. A bank can&amp;rsquo;t give transaction logs to a fraud detection partner. An e-commerce platform can&amp;rsquo;t export customer behavior to their analytics consultants.</description>

      <description>How synthetic data generation transformed ML development workflows&#xA;Machine learning teams waste weeks waiting for production data access. Legal reviews, anonymization pipelines, compliance approvals—by the time data arrives, project timelines have slipped. Development environments sit empty while engineers context-switch to other work.&#xA;We saw this problem across multiple client engagements and decided to build a solution: Fabri, a synthetic data generation platform that gives ML teams realistic, privacy-safe datasets in minutes instead of weeks.</description>

      <description>How we created a platform-agnostic referral tracking system that increased organizer acquisition by 40%&#xA;A ticketing startup came to us with a growth challenge: they wanted to launch a referral program to acquire new event organizers, but their engineering team was already stretched thin. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to build referral infrastructure into their core platform.&#xA;Most referral solutions—Rewardful, FirstPromoter, PartnerStack—require deep integration with your billing and user systems. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option here.</description>

      <description>A case study in turning event data into personalized engagement&#xA;A ticketing startup approached us with a familiar problem: they had thousands of users across dozens of cities, but their email marketing felt like shouting into the void. Generic blast emails. Low open rates. Even lower conversions.&#xA;They needed a system that could understand their users—where they lived, what events they attended, what they might want next—and reach them with the right message at the right time.</description>
