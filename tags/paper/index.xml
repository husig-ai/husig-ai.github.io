      <description>[Paper Exploration] Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures Abstract There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems.</description>

      <description>[Paper Exploration] SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique&amp;quot; Author: Nitesh V. Chawla, Kevin W. Bowyer, Lawrence O. Hall, W. Philip Kegelmeyer&#xA;Published on 9 Jun 2011&#xA;Abstract An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples.</description>

      <description>[Paper Exploration] An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale&amp;quot; Authors: Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, Jakob Uszkoreit, Neil Houlsby&#xA;Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2021&#xA;Abstract While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place.</description>
