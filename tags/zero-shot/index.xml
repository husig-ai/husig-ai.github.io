Berg, Wan-Yen Lo, Piotr Dollár, Ross Girshick&#xA;Published on 2023&#xA;The Segment Anything Model (SAM) was developed by Meta AI as a foundation model for image segmentation tasks. The goal of SAM is to create a universal model that can efficiently handle various segmentation tasks with minimal prompting.</description>

      <description>[Paper Exploration] Train Once, Test Anywhere: Zero-Shot Learning for Text Classification Author: Pushpankar Kumar Pushp, Muktabh Mayank Srivastava&#xA;Published on 2017&#xA;Abstract Zero-shot Learners are models capable of predicting unseen classes. In this work, we propose a Zero-shot Learning approach for text categorization. Our method involves training model on a large corpus of sentences to learn the relationship between a sentence and embedding of sentence&amp;rsquo;s tags. Learning such relationship makes the model generalize to unseen sentences, tags, and even new datasets provided they can be put into same embedding space.</description>
