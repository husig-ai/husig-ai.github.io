      <description>[Paper Exploration] Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization Author: Diederik P. Kingma, Jimmy Ba&#xA;Published on 2014&#xA;Abstract We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters.</description>
